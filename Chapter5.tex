\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

We presented a scheme developed using binary rewriting that can defend against a number of buffer
overflow attacks. Our scheme is practical and easy to deploy with the only factor limiting
deployment right now is maturity of the binary rewriter.

We demonstrated the effectiveness of our scheme using the benchmarks developed by Wilander and
Kamkar by successfully defending against all attack methods in those benchmarks. A real-world attack
 on a lightweight HTTP server was also mitigated using our scheme.

Future work involves extending the binary rewriter to work on larger binaries and testing against
more real-world attacks. Interesting avenues for future research are software diversification with
a binary rewriter and self-healing techniques with binary rewriting.
