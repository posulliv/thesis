\chapter{Introduction}

The dominant form of software security vulnerability is the buffer overflow vulnerability. Attacks
based on this vulnerability have been the subject of extensive research and a significant number of
defenses have been proposed for dealing with attacks of this nature. Despite this extensive
research, buffer overflows continue to be exploited in real world attacks. This is because most
buffer overflow defenses provide only partial coverage, and the attacks have adopted to exploit
problems that are not well defended.
