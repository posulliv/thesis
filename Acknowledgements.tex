I owe my gratitude to all the people who have made this thesis possible and because of whom my graduate experience has been one that I will cherish forever.

First and foremost I'd like to thank my advisor, Professor Rajeev Barua for giving me an invaluable opportunity to work on challenging and extremely interesting projects over the past four years. He has always made himself available for help and advice and there has never been an occasion when I've knocked on his door and he hasn't given me time. It has been a pleasure to work with and learn from such an extraordinary individual.
