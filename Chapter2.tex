StackGuard \cite{stackguard-98} places a 'canary' on the stack between local variables and the
return address. This canary value is designed to warn of stack corruption since validating the
integrity of the canary value is an effective means of ensuring that the function return address has
not been corrupted. Microsoft's compiler also supports the insertion of stack canaries with the /GS
option.

StackGuard, PointGuard, and ProPolice involve compile-time analysis and transformation. Thus, unless
the source code for an applicatoin is available, these techniques can not be used thereby hindering
the ability to easily deploy these techniques.
