In this thesis, we will discuss the concept of using binary rewriting to enforce protect a binary
from various attack forms. More specifically, we will study various attacks that happen in the real
world and present techniques that can be employed within a binary rewriter to protect a binary from
these attacks.

Binary rewriting is a nascent field and little research has been done on applications of binary
rewriting. In particular, there is great potential for applications of binary rewriting in software
security. Numerous attacks on application programs assume that application binaries are laid out in
certain ways. Our defense scheme implemented using binary rewriting technology can prevent many of
these attacks.
