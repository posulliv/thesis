In this thesis, we will discuss the concept of using binary rewriting to enforce protect a binary
from various attack forms. More specifically, we will study various attacks that happen in the real
world and present techniques that can be employed within a binary rewriter to protect a binary from
these attacks.

Binary rewriting is a nascent field and little research has been done on applications of binary
rewriting. The field has great potential for the software security field. Numerous attacks assume
binary applications are vulnerable in certain ways and our defense scheme implemented using a binary
rewriter can prevent many of these attacks.
